# BedRkBase Implementation Tracker

This tracker monitors the implementation status of all critical improvements and missing patterns identified in the re-evaluation checklist. Update this file as items progress. For code patterns and best practices, refer to `snippets.md`.

## High Priority Items

| Item | Status | Assignee | Description / Next Steps | Acceptance Criteria | Reference |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Authentication Coverage** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Auth middleware applied to POST /api/establishments, but several sensitive endpoints still missing auth middleware. Create protected routes registry. | All sensitive endpoints require authentication. | Checklist 1, 6 |
| **Rate Limiting** | âœ… Complete |  | Rate limiting middleware implemented with separate configurations for public and authenticated endpoints. Consider adding Redis store for distributed deployments. | All API endpoints have rate limiting; different limits for public/authenticated; logs and error responses. | Checklist 6, 8 |
| **Supabase Health Check** | âœ… Complete |  | Supabase connection is tested on server startup; server will not start if the check fails. Pattern documented in snippets.md. | Automated health check runs on deploy/startup; failures are logged and alert. | Checklist 3a |
| **Sensitive Data Logging** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Log sanitization utility implemented in `logger.ts`, but several instances of password and token data still appearing in logs. Ensure consistent use of sanitized logging across all modules. | No sensitive data appears in logs. | Checklist 4 |
| **Transaction Handling** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Transaction wrapper utility implemented in `transactionWrapper.ts`, but most operations still lack transaction wrapping, risking data inconsistency. Apply the utility to all multi-operation functions. | All multi-operation DB logic uses transactions. | Checklist 3 |

## Medium Priority Items

| Item | Status | Assignee | Description / Next Steps | Acceptance Criteria | Reference |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Request Validation Middleware** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Zod validation middleware implemented, but not consistently applied across all endpoints. Audit all endpoints to ensure universal application. | All handlers use validation; errors return 400 with details. | Checklist 5, 8 |
| **API Response Standardization** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Response format varies across different controllers. Implement ResponseBuilder utility and apply consistently. | All responses follow standard format; pagination metadata included. | Checklist 5, 8, 9 |
| **Service Layer Abstraction** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Service layer between controllers and data access being implemented. | Route handlers only call services; business rules in service layer; unit tests. | Checklist 8 |
| **Error Handling Consistency** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | ApiError class implemented and used consistently across routes with proper error type handling, but response formats still vary. Standardize error responses using global error middleware. | All thrown errors are ApiError; consistent error responses. | Checklist 2, 3, 9 |
| **Supabase Usage Consistency** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Review backend/frontend Supabase usage. Configuration and session management patterns need alignment. | Documented, consistent usage across stack. | Checklist 3a |
| **Role-Based Authorization** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Basic role checking works but lacks fine-grained permission support. Implement permission-based authorization alongside roles. | All routes have appropriate role/permission checks. | Checklist 1 |
| **Backend & Frontend Connectivity** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Basic connectivity checks exist in `testConnection.tsx` and API health endpoints, but lack comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms. Implement robust connectivity monitoring with automatic retry policies and user-friendly fallback UI components. | Connectivity issues are detected and handled gracefully; automatic retries implemented; user-friendly fallback UI shown during connectivity issues. | Checklist 7 |
| **Pagination Implementation** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Pagination implemented inconsistently across endpoints. Extract pagination logic to a reusable utility function. | All list endpoints use consistent pagination. | Checklist 3, 5 |
| **Styles & CSS Consistency** | âœ… Complete |  | All frontend pages use Tailwind CSS utility classes, CSS variables, and fallback global classes for consistent, accessible, and responsive design. Style utilities and patterns are documented in snippets.md. | All components use consistent, accessible, and responsive styles; style guidelines are documented. | Checklist 7 |

## Low Priority Items

| Item | Status | Assignee | Description / Next Steps | Acceptance Criteria | Reference |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Structured Logging Format** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Most logs use structured format, but some use string concatenation. Enforce consistent structured logging format across all modules. | All logs use structured format for machine readability. | Checklist 4 |
| **Centralized Config Management** | ðŸŸ  Partially Implemented |  | Config module implemented in `config.ts` with Zod validation that throws on missing required variables, but not used consistently across all modules. Ensure all environment variable access goes through the config module. | All config via module; missing vars cause startup error. | Checklist 8 |
| **Log Level Guidelines** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Some critical operations use incorrect log levels. Document log level usage guidelines and audit existing logs. | All logs use correct level; guidelines in docs. | Checklist 4 |
| **Frontend Token Refresh** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Basic token storage implemented but lacks refresh handling. Implement token refresh and secure storage patterns. | Tokens are refreshed and securely stored. | Checklist 7 |
| **Loading/Error UI Consistency** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Loading state handling inconsistent across components. Create standardized loading and error display components. | All pages/components use standard UI for loading/errors. | Checklist 7 |
| **Input Sanitization** | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |  | Basic validation present but lacks comprehensive sanitization. Add specific sanitization for HTML/SQL injection risks. | All user inputs are sanitized. | Checklist 6 |
| **Correlation IDs for Logging** | ðŸ”´ Not Started |  | Add correlation IDs to link related error logs and for cross-service request tracing. | All logs include correlation IDs. | Checklist 2, 4 |
| **Error Codes** | ðŸ”´ Not Started |  | Consider adding error codes for better client-side handling and structured error codes for better tracking without exposing details. | Standardized error codes in responses. | Checklist 1, 2 |

## 3a. Supabase Integration & Health

- [✅] Verify Supabase client initialization and environment variable validation
  - **Assessment**: Supabase client is initialized in `backend/src/utils/supabaseClient.ts` with strict environment variable checks. Missing variables cause a logged error and process exit.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure all deployment environments provide valid Supabase credentials and document required variables in `.env.example`.

- [✅] Check Supabase connection health check implementation
  - **Assessment**: `testConnection` function in `supabaseClient.ts` attempts to fetch a session and logs the result, supporting operational diagnostics.
  - **Recommendation**: Integrate this health check into automated startup or monitoring scripts.

- [✅] Confirm secure handling of Supabase keys and error logging
  - **Assessment**: Keys are loaded from environment variables and never hardcoded. Errors are logged with context.
  - **Recommendation**: Periodically audit logs and environment files to ensure no accidental key exposure.

- [⚠️] Ensure Supabase errors are handled gracefully in authentication and API flows
  - **Assessment**: Most errors are logged and returned with appropriate messages, but some edge cases may not be fully covered.
  - **Recommendation**: Review all Supabase API usages for comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

  - **Recommendation**: Implement log sanitization for sensitive fields

- [⚠️] Verify structured logging format for machine-readability
  - **Assessment**: Most logs use structured format, but some use string concatenation
  - **Recommendation**: Enforce consistent structured logging format across all modules

## 5. API Route Implementations

- [⚠️] Check consistent pattern usage across all route handlers
  - **Assessment**: Inconsistent patterns between older and newer endpoints
  - **Recommendation**: Refactor older endpoints to match current best practices

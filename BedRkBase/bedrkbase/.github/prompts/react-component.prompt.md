# Generate React Component

Your goal is to generate a new React component following BedRkBase conventions.

Requirements:

* Use proper prop types with descriptive interfaces
* Include error boundaries where appropriate
* Add proper accessibility attributes
* Include component documentation with JSDoc
* Use CSS modules with Tailwind
* Follow responsive design principles
* Include proper loading and error states

Component Structure:
* Export named component
* Props interface above component

Ask for:
1. Component name

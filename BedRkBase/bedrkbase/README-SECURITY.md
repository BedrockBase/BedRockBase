# BedRkBase Security Guidelines

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: Security Breach Risk ðŸš¨

If you have accidentally exposed sensitive credentials like API keys or database passwords:

1. **IMMEDIATELY rotate all credentials** through the Supabase dashboard
2. **Revoke compromised keys** and generate new ones
3. **Check logs** for any unauthorized access

## Environment Variables Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
   - Add `.env*` to your `.gitignore` file
   - Use example files like `.env.example` with dummy values

2. **Use different keys for different environments**
   - Development
   - Testing
   - Staging
   - Production

3. **Limit permissions on service accounts**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Create specific service accounts for specific tasks

4. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - Set up a regular schedule for key rotation
   - Update after team member departures

5. **Store credentials securely**
   - Use secret management tools like GitHub Secrets, Vercel Environment Variables, etc.
   - Consider using a vault solution for team access

## Authentication Security Best Practices

1. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Use generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
   - Log detailed errors server-side only

2. **Rate limit authentication attempts**
   - Prevent brute force attacks
   - Implement progressive delays

3. **Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Offer MFA options to users
   - Require MFA for administrative accounts

4. **Monitor for suspicious activities**
   - Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts
   - Watch for login attempts from unusual locations

## Common Authentication Issues

1. **"Invalid credentials" error**
   - Verify the email exists in the database
   - Check if the user has confirmed their email
   - Ensure the password hash is correct
   - Verify the account isn't locked or disabled

2. **Connection issues**
   - Check Supabase service status
   - Verify API endpoints are correctly configured
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set

3. **CORS issues**
   - Check allowed origins in Supabase configuration
   - Verify the request is coming from an allowed domain

## Using the Auth Debug Tools

The project includes authentication debugging tools that can help diagnose issues:

1. Enable debug mode on the sign-in page
2. Use the "Test Supabase Connection" button to verify connectivity
3. Use the "Test Email Validity" to check if an email exists in the system

For more complex issues, check the browser console and server logs.
